Extended Deadline: IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Comp=
uting (CBDCom 2016)

18-21 July 2016, Toulouse France
http://cbdcom2016.sciencesconf.org/

EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE: March 25, 2016

--------------------------------------------

Cloud is a virtual computing resource, which realizes self-maintenance and =
management, usually in the form of some large server cluster, including com=
puting servers, storage servers, bandwidth resources, etc. Cloud computing =
is the fusion and development of grid computing, distributed computing, par=
allel computing, utility computing, network storage technologies, virtualiz=
ation, load balancing and other traditional computer technologies and netwo=
rk technology. Virtualization, dynamicity and scalability, the distributed =
mass data storage and management, as well as flexible service, are the main=
 technologies of cloud computing. There are still many challenges in cloud =
systems and platform, cloud computing, database, virtualization, reuse and =
elasticity problems.

Big data overall architecture consists of three layers: data storage, data =
processing and data analysis. Data storage layer stores complex type and ma=
ss data, data processing layer realizes real-time processing of massive dat=
a, and only through data analysis layer, smart, in-depth and valuable infor=
mation are got. When talking about big data, one thinks first to the 4V cha=
racteristics of big data, namely Volumes, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity. =
Big data processing key technology generally includes: data acquisition, da=
ta pre-processing, data storage and data management, data analysis and mini=
ng, big show and application (big data retrieval, data visualization, big d=
ata applications, data security, etc.).

The IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Computing is a prem=
ier forum for researchers, practitioners, developers and users who are inte=
rested in cloud computing and big data to explore new ideas, techniques and=
 tools, as well as to exchange experience. Besides the latest research achi=
evements. This conference also covers innovative commercial data management=
 systems, innovative commercial applications of cloud computing and big dat=
a technology, and experience in applying recent research advances to real-w=
orld problems. After the success of IEEE CBDCom 2015, Beijing China,. CBDCo=
m 2016 will be the second edition of the international Conference.

                         Call for participation

           Online Survey on use of Model-Based Engineering and
            Auto-generated Code in Safety-critical Applications
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSwE) and the use of Auto-Generated Code
(AGC) for safety-critical applications have become more and more popular.
Typical areas include aerospace, automotive, nuclear, military, and many
others. MBSwE with automated code generation is often considered to produce
""code with fewer bugs and much faster"".  The current focus towards 
autonomous
systems poses new possibilities and challenges for MBSwE and automated code
generation.

We are evaluating experiences in the use of MBSwE/AGC at NASA and other
relevant industries.  This survey assesses the current 
state-of-the-practice,
advantages and disadvantages, V&V practices, and certification issues for
safety-critical systems that use MBSwE and/or execute code that is 
generated
from models.


We would appreciate it if you could participate in our online survey before
                                          March 31st, 2016.

responses are anonymous, unless you specifically choose to provide personal
information and your email address.  At completion, we will be happy to 
send
a copy of our report to respondents who provide their email addresses 
during
the survey or request the report by sending an e-mail to
SurveyMBSwEandAGC@gmail.com.

Please forward this call for participation to any and all of your
