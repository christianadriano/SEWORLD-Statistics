Extended Deadline: IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Comp=
uting (CBDCom 2016)

18-21 July 2016, Toulouse France
http://cbdcom2016.sciencesconf.org/

EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE: March 25, 2016

--------------------------------------------

Cloud is a virtual computing resource, which realizes self-maintenance and =
management, usually in the form of some large server cluster, including com=
puting servers, storage servers, bandwidth resources, etc. Cloud computing =
is the fusion and development of grid computing, distributed computing, par=
allel computing, utility computing, network storage technologies, virtualiz=
ation, load balancing and other traditional computer technologies and netwo=
rk technology. Virtualization, dynamicity and scalability, the distributed =
mass data storage and management, as well as flexible service, are the main=
 technologies of cloud computing. There are still many challenges in cloud =
systems and platform, cloud computing, database, virtualization, reuse and =
elasticity problems.

Big data overall architecture consists of three layers: data storage, data =
processing and data analysis. Data storage layer stores complex type and ma=
ss data, data processing layer realizes real-time processing of massive dat=
a, and only through data analysis layer, smart, in-depth and valuable infor=
mation are got. When talking about big data, one thinks first to the 4V cha=
racteristics of big data, namely Volumes, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity. =
Big data processing key technology generally includes: data acquisition, da=
ta pre-processing, data storage and data management, data analysis and mini=
ng, big show and application (big data retrieval, data visualization, big d=
ata applications, data security, etc.).

The IEEE International Conference on Cloud and Big Data Computing is a prem=
ier forum for researchers, practitioners, developers and users who are inte=
rested in cloud computing and big data to explore new ideas, techniques and=
 tools, as well as to exchange experience. Besides the latest research achi=
evements. This conference also covers innovative commercial data management=
 systems, innovative commercial applications of cloud computing and big dat=
a technology, and experience in applying recent research advances to real-w=
orld problems. After the success of IEEE CBDCom 2015, Beijing China,. CBDCo=
m 2016 will be the second edition of the international Conference.

----------------
SCOPE AND TOPICS
----------------
