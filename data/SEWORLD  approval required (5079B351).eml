                         Call for participation

           Online Survey on use of Model-Based Engineering and
            Auto-generated Code in Safety-critical Applications
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSwE) and the use of Auto-Generated Code
(AGC) for safety-critical applications have become more and more popular.
Typical areas include aerospace, automotive, nuclear, military, and many
others. MBSwE with automated code generation is often considered to produce
"code with fewer bugs and much faster".  The current focus towards 
autonomous
systems poses new possibilities and challenges for MBSwE and automated code
generation.

We are evaluating experiences in the use of MBSwE/AGC at NASA and other
relevant industries.  This survey assesses the current 
state-of-the-practice,
advantages and disadvantages, V&V practices, and certification issues for
safety-critical systems that use MBSwE and/or execute code that is 
generated
from models.


We would appreciate it if you could participate in our online survey before
                                          March 31st, 2016.
The survey is located at
                       https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/mbsweandagc
and we estimate that it would take about 30 minutes to complete. All
responses are anonymous, unless you specifically choose to provide personal
information and your email address.  At completion, we will be happy to 
send
a copy of our report to respondents who provide their email addresses 
during
the survey or request the report by sending an e-mail to
SurveyMBSwEandAGC@gmail.com.

Please forward this call for participation to any and all of your 
colleagues with
experience in this topic.


Thank you in advance for participating in our survey.
